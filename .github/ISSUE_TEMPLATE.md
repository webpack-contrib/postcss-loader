Briefly describe the issue you are experiencing (or the feature you want to see
added to the plugin). Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened
instead. Remember, this is _not_ a place to ask questions. For that, go to

### `Details`
---

Describe in more detail the problem you have been experiencing, if necessary.

### `Error (Logs|Stacks)`
---

Create a [gist](https://gist.github.com) which is a paste of your **full**
logs, and link them here.

Do **not** paste your full logs here (or at least hide them by using a `<details></details>` block), as it will make this issue long and hard
to read! If you are reporting a bug, **always** include logs!

### `Reproduction [Code]`
---

Please remember that, with sample code; it's easier to reproduce bug and much
faster to fix it.

Please refer to a simple code example.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<user>/<sample>
```
